## **A New Era at Hogwarts**  

### **The Story**  
After the fall of the Dark Lord, Hogwarts entered a new era of **innovation and modernization**. Under **Professor McGonagall‚Äôs leadership**, the wizarding world embraced new ideas, blending ancient magic with modern technology.  

As part of this transformation, Hogwarts introduced a groundbreaking subject: **Programming**. Now, young witches and wizards can master the art of coding alongside their magical studies.  

You are among the first graduates of this **new-age Hogwarts curriculum**, and as your final challenge, **Professor McGonagall** has assigned your team a critical task:  

> **Develop an advanced system to manage students, houses, courses, and magical items to ensure Hogwarts remains the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry for generations to come.**  

Even the wizarding world needs a **digital upgrade**!  

## Advanced Features

  - Update earned points for a student after submitting a quiz , done by comparing their answers with the correct answers.

  - Update house points whenever one of its students submits a quiz, so we can determine which house has the most points.
- use some usefull pakages like (respect/validation-JWT-vlucas/phpdotenv-symfony)
- Use Supabase as a PostgreSQL-based serverless backend for secure storage and auto-scaling capabilities. 
- Implement ORM methods like:
getAll(), getOne(), insert(), update(), delete(), getWithJoin(), getWith2Joins()
inside the Database class : [Database.php](app/Core/Database.php)
