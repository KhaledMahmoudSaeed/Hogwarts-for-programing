# A New Era at Hogwarts

## Story

After the fall of the Dark Lord, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry entered a new age of rebuilding and innovation. Under Professor McGonagall’s leadership, the magical world embraced change, blending ancient wisdom with new ideas. As part of this transformation, Hogwarts introduced a groundbreaking course: **Programming**. Here, young witches and wizards could learn the art of coding alongside their magical studies.

You are among the first students to graduate from this course—a pioneer in this new era of magic and technology. As your final challenge before stepping into the world, Professor McGonagall has given your team the crucial task of developing an application to help organize students, houses, courses, and magical items. This system will ensure that Hogwarts remains the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry for generations to come.

With the rapid growth of the wizarding world, even Hogwarts needs a digital upgrade!
