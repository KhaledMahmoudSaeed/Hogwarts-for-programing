            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>
                Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was founded over a thousand years ago in the secluded
                Scottish Highlands. The castle and its grounds hold a history rich with magic, mystery, and legends
                that
                have been passed down through the ages.
            </p>
            <p>
                The school was built by four of the greatest witches and wizards of the age: <strong>Godric
                    Gryffindor</strong>, <strong>Helga Hufflepuff</strong>, <strong>Rowena Ravenclaw</strong>, and
                <strong>Salazar Slytherin</strong>. Their vision was to create a place where young witches and
                wizards
                could learn and master the magical arts in an environment that balanced academic excellence with the
                natural wonders of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the centuries, Hogwarts has been the stage for numerous legendary events – from daring duels
                and
                enchanted tournaments to the secret meetings of wizards and mystical creatures. Its enchanted
                corridors
                and moving staircases hold countless stories of bravery, friendship, and the eternal battle between
                light and dark.
